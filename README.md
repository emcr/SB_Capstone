## Predicting Emergency Room Payer Mix
Foundations of Data Science Capstone Project: Using a geography's economic and demographic characteristics to predict proportion of emergency department patients with commercial health insurance.

## Abstract
In this analysis, we tested the hypothesis that the demographic and economic characteristics of a particular zip code can predict the commercial patient proportion of total volume at emergency department facilities located in that zip code. We found that approximately 22.6% of the variation in commercial patient volume for the facilities in our dataset can be attributed to the demographic and economic characteristics we identified in our analysis. 

The resulting model can be used by our client, an emergency department staffing company, to target its business development efforts toward those facilities located in zip codes which indicate more patients who have commercial health insurance. According to our final linear regression model, facilities with the most commercial patients tend to be privately owned or nonprofit facilities located in zip codes with higher wages, more Asian/Asian-American residents, and a large service and hospitality industry.

The analysis was performed on a dataset consisting of all emergency department facilities in the state of California for which payer mix, demographic, and economic data was available -- a total of 346 facilities. We obtained demographic and economic data on each facility's zip code from the 2010 Census and the latest American Community Survey. Because of the relatively small size of the dataset, we see this as a preliminary analysis, and our conclusions should be tested on a more complete dataset. We believe our findings prove the value of this analysis and recommend that our client purchase or create a larger dataset to test the findings and, if necessary, train a new model that is more general to the entire country.
